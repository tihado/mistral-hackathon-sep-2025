# Shopping MCP Server with SerpAPI + Virtual Try-On

A comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides intelligent shopping assistance with real-time product search, virtual try-on capabilities, and personalized recommendations.

## Overview

This MCP server integrates with Google Shopping via SerpAPI to provide real-time product search, comparison, and recommendations. It features semantic search using vector embeddings, virtual try-on for clothing and furniture, and price tracking capabilities. The server is designed to work seamlessly with any MCP-compatible chat client (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.).

## Prerequisites

- Install uv (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- Python 3.13+
- SerpAPI key (optional, for real product search)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd shopping-mcp
```

2. Install python version & dependencies:

```bash
uv python install
uv sync --locked
```

3. Set up environment variables (optional):

```bash
export SERPAPI_KEY="your_serpapi_key_here"
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
```

## Usage

Start the server on port 3000:

```bash
uv run main.py
```

The server will start with mock data if no API keys are provided, making it perfect for testing and development. For full functionality, provide both SerpAPI and Gemini API keys.

## Running the Inspector

### Requirements

- Node.js: ^22.7.5

### Quick Start (UI mode)

To get up and running right away with the UI, just execute the following:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

The inspector server will start up and the UI will be accessible at http://localhost:6274.

You can test your server locally by selecting:

- Transport Type: Streamable HTTP
- URL: http://127.0.0.1:3000/mcp

## Development

### Architecture

The server uses:

- **FastMCP**: For MCP server implementation
- **Qdrant**: For vector database and semantic search
- **Sentence Transformers**: For text embeddings
- **SerpAPI**: For Google Shopping integration
- **Google Generative AI**: For AI-powered virtual try-on image generation
- **PIL**: For image processing and fallback virtual try-on
- **Pydantic**: For data validation and serialization

### Mock Data Mode

When no SerpAPI key is provided, the server runs in mock data mode, providing realistic sample data for testing and development. This makes it easy to test the MCP tools without requiring API keys.

### Extending the Server

To add new functionality:

1. **New Tools**: Add new `@mcp.tool` decorated functions
2. **New Resources**: Add new `@mcp.resource` decorated functions
3. **New Prompts**: Add new `@mcp.prompt` decorated functions

The server is designed to be easily extensible with additional shopping features like wishlist management, order tracking, or integration with other e-commerce APIs.
